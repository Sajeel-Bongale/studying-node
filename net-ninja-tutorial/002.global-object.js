    In the browser environment the global object is the window which provides access to useful methods
    like setTimeout, setInterval, alert, etc.

    However, in the Node environment the global object is, well, the 'global' object. It provides similar
    functionality as is done by the browser's window object.

    NodeJS provides a special property on the global object called __dirname. It gives the complete
    path of the current directory that your file is in.
    Another property called __filename gives you the current file name along with the complete path.
