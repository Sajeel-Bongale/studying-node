    Frontend Vs Backend Development

    Front-end development is about everything that happens in the web browser. It's about designing and building
    the final website that's going to be visible to the user, and therefore, the name front-end. The front-end developer
    uses the basic technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which together form the front-end technology stack.
    Now, many modern front-end developers add more stuff to the front-end stack like React or Angular or Redux or
    GraphQL.

    Backend is about everything that happens on the web server, so everything that is invisible to the final user and
    therefore the name back-end. A basic server is really just a computer that is connected to the internet
    which, first, stores a website's files like HTML, CSS, and images, and second, runs an HTTP server that is capable
    of understanding URLs, requests, and also delivering responses. HTTP server software is what actually communicates
    with the browser using requests and responses. Therefore, it is like the bridge between the front-end and the
    back-end of a website or web application.

    A static server can serve static files to the client via HTTP. But we want to develop an application which talks to
    the databases then we create a dynamic web application.
