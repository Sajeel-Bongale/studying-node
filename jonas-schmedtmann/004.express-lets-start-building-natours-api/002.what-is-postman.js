    What is Postman

    Postman is a beautiful tool that allows us to do API testing. It's a little bit like a browser. We can do all kinds
    of requests and then receive the response simply as text then work with that response. So as they say Postman
    simplifies API development.

    To install postman, we use the url getpostman.com and download postman.

    We can save requests and create collections and folders to organise the requests. We can run automatic tests.
    We can set up different development environments or production environments.
