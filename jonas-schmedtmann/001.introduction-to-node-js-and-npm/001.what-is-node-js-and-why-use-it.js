    What is NodeJs and why use it?

    NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime built on Google's open-source V8 JavaScript engine. Browser natively understands
    HTML, CSS and Javascript. So, javascript frameworks like Angular, React can be executed in the browser. So, in
    this case, the browser is the JavaScript Runtime.

    NodeJs is another Javascript runtime, container or an environment in which we can run javascript programs and
    execute them but outside of a browser. V8 engine actually parses and run the code in NodeJS and not in the browser.

    NodeJS can be run as a server in which we can access the file system and better networking capabilities.

    Node applications are so fast and so scalable because NodeJS is single threaded based on an event driven,
    non-blocking I/O model which makes NodeJS very lightweight and efficient.

    Node is a good option for creating realtime chat applications, server-side web application or for data streaming
    like youtube.

    Node should not be used when creating some super heavy server-side processing like having image manipulations,
    video conversion, file compression.
