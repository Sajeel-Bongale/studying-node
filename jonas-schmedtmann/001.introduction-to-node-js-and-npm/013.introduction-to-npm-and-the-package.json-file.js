    Introduction to npm and the package.json file

    The node package manager is a command line interface app that automatically comes included with Node JS in which we
    install and manage Open Source packages. The packages come from the package repository that is also npm.

    Npm is actually both the command line interface app that we use to manage the packages and also the repository
    itself. It's the largest software registry in the world.

    npmjs.com is where all these packages are hosted. The first thing we do is use the command npm init to add the
    package.json file in our project.
