    When you will use express to set up a server, you will usually use it for one of the two purposes:
    1. Setting up a JSON API
    2. Setting up Server Side Rendering(SSR)

    In 1, you will use the response.json() method to send the response formatted as a JSON object.
    In 2, you will send a HTML template that has been compiled at the server side using response.render() method.
