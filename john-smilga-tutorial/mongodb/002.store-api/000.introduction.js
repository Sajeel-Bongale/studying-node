    This documentation will refer two separate places.
    1. The videos walking through the creation of the project and
    2. The actual github project

    In the first commit for the store-api GitHub project, we will set up the project and add content to run the
    app with the addition of some basic middleware.

    // Personal Note: A postman collection has also been setup with the same name of the project.

    All the documentation of MongoDB will be done in the subsequent JS files.
