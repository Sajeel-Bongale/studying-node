    MongoDB is a NoSQL and non relational DB.

    Unlike other relational DBs where data is stored as rows and columns in a table,
    in MongoDB we store it as JSON objects.

    Instead of tables we have Collections.
    Instead of rows we have Documents.
    A document is a set of key value pairs.
    Values can be strings, arrays, numbers, booleans, objects etc.

    We will be hosting it in the cloud.
