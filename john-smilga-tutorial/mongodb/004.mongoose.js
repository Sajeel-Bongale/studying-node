    To connect to our MongoDB database from our application, we need to use a package
    that makes use of the connection string we inserted previously.

    There are two such popular packages. One is the mongodb package provided by the authors of MongoDB
    themselves and the other one is called mongoose. We will be using mongoose in this tutorial.

    Mongoose is an object data modelling library. The reason that it is popular because it
    comes with a lot of features that assist us in easier development.

    It has an easy to use API and does all of the heavy lifting behind the scenes.
