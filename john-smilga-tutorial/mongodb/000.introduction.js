    This documentation will refer two separate places.
    1. The videos walking through the creation of the project and
    2. The actual github project

    The MongoDB explanation in the video begins around the 40 minute mark.
    Before the MongoDB explanation begins there are a few videos about setting up the NodeJS environment
    along with the scaffold for the task controllers and routes. This is reflected in the first commit in
    the Git Repo.

    There is also a brief explanation about REST APIs which will not be documented here because they
    are not in the scope of this project.

    // Personal Note: A postman collection has also been setup with the same name of the project.

    All the documentation of MongoDB will be done in the subsequent JS files.
