/*

    MVC
    MVC is a pattern used in server side development to keep parts of the application separate from each
    other such that each individual piece is only responsible for one part of the application.
    Model - Represents your data in code. It can be created using classes
    View - Generates what the user sees. This involves the use of templating engines to generate HTML
    Controller - This is the route handler. Orchestrates connection between your model and view
