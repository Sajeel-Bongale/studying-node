    Why do we use Express.js?
    1. We use expressjs to simplify the server side logic.
    2. It helps the developer to focus on the business logic instead of the implementation or handling details
    of the request responses.
    3. It is a sort of framework that does the heavy lifting for us.

    Alternatives to ExpressJS
    Vanilla JS, Adonis.js, Koa, Sails.js
