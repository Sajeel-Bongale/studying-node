    createProduct method is available when we define a relationship between 2 things. Sequelize helps us to make
    associations and also provides us a way in which our models know each other.

    example 1
     req.user.createProduct({
        title: title,
        imageUrl: imageUrl,
        price: price,
        description: description,
    })
