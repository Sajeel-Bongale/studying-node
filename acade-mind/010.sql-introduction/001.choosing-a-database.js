    Database helps to store and retrieve data easily. It is quicker than accessing the data from the file as the data
    begins to grow overtime. Database also doesnt require us to read the whole file for finding a particular value.

    SQL is a table which consist of fields which have rows and columns. SQL based database allows us to relate
    different tables. SQL databases has strong schema in which we define if the field is a number, string, boolean etc
    and also how we structure the table.

    Thus, core things about SQL databases are:
        1. The structure of the data looks like (eg: in a table format)
        2. The data type of each field
        3. Relating different tables with some important relation like one to many, many to many or one to
        one. So, the tables can be connected.

    SQL stands for structured query languages. Queries are command we use to interact with the database.
