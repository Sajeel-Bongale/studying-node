    Horizontal and vertical are two approaches we can use to scale our databases.

    In horizontal servers, we add more servers and we can do this at infinity as we can buy new servers on cloud or on
    our data centers and connect them to our database and split our data across these servers.

    While in vertical scaling we make our existing server stronger by adding CPU or memory.

    Horizontal scaling is difficult or impossible as it involves creating many servers. If we have hundreds or
    thousands of users than reading and writing queries can become complex.
    Whereas for noSQL scaling is easy and sometimes the packages also helps to create databases for us. It is great for
    performance when mass requests are to be read and written.
