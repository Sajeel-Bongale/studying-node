    For creating database on the server we need to open our project on the workBench and add a table in the tables
    session on the left side bar.

    We then create a table with the column names and the data type we expect in each field.

    Once the table is created we click on the Apply button and our changes are saved. We can then view the table from
    the sidebar.
