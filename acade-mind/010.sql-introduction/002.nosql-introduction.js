    In SQL we had tables but in noSQL we have collections. In collections we find documents. These documents are very
    close to what we describe in javascript as data -> example 1

    noSQL does not have a strict schema. For example we can have name and age in one collection but just name in
    another collection. We can store multiple documents with different structures in the same collection.

    In noSQL we do not have real world data but we go for duplicate data. As data duplication is possible we
    do not have to relate one table to another as most details from one table are also duplicated in another.

    The core features of noSQL database are:
        1. It does not have strong data schema. So, no structure is required.
        2. Usually there are no or few connections in noSQL databases.

    example 1
    {
        name: "Max",
        age: 29
    }
